# Mnist Datast Classification by Basic Machine Learning Libraries

A handwritten digit classifier using Logistic Regression on the MNIST dataset, featuring data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization with Python machine learning libraries (scikit-learn).

I use logsitic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (MLP) for classification.
